Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710 times.[161] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances.

	<p>Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–18) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[162][163] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–64), Santillana (1971–88), Ferenc Puskás (1958–66), Hugo Sánchez (1985–92), Karim Benzema (2009–current) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals. The fastest goal in the history of the club (12 seconds) was scored by the Brazilian Ronaldo on 3 December 2003 during a league match against Atlético Madrid.[</p>
	<p>The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fourteen times[168] and for the most semi-final appearances (31). As of December 2019, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[169] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide.[170] The same season the team tied the win-streak for games in the Champions League, with ten.[171] In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game</p>
