						<h1 class="title">About Real Medrid CF</h1>
						<p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly referred to as Real Madrid or simply Real, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception</p>
						<p>The club was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, the world's most valuable football team.[6] In 2021, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €640.7 million.[7] Real Madrid is one of the most widely supported teams internationally</p>
						<p>Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals.</p>
